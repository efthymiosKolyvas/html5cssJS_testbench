# HTML5 CSS3 JS test-bench

The directory is a repository of things learned:

## 1. Website development

- Is a testcase of `flexbox` to form the web design in a responsive fashion. Check the stylesheet (css) on the use of flexbox. Uses tips from [the css-tricks tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- The node module `processPosts.js` uses `async` to operate on the files inside a directory. The module compiles the .json and .md to .html files, to be infused in the single-webpage (under the 'News' section) or be linked to the main page (as links to the 'News posts', that is the 'Read more' links). 

### How to use

1. Update the node modules in the local repository by `npm install`
2. Run the express server with `nodemon website`
